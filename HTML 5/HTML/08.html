        <h1>1. The Last Train Home</h1>
        <p>
            Every night at 11:47 p.m., the last train rattled through Platform Nine, nearly empty except for ghosts of
            tired souls. Arun took that train for seven years, always sitting by the window, always pretending not to
            hope.</p>

        <p> On one rainy evening, a woman sat across from him. She wore a red scarf and carried a book with no title on
            the cover. When the train lurched forward, she smiled like she already knew him.</p>
        <p> “Funny how the last train never feels like the end,” she said.</p>

        <p> They talked between stations—about missed chances, cities they almost moved to, people they never confessed
            feelings to. The tunnel lights flickered like unfinished sentences.</p>

        <p> At Arun’s stop, he stood, suddenly afraid. “Will I see you again?”</p>

        <p> She shook her head gently. “Some people only exist to remind us we’re still alive.”</p>

        <p> The doors closed. The train moved on.</p>

        <p> The next night, Arun didn’t take the train. He resigned from his job, called an old friend, and booked a
            one-way ticket to the coast.</p>

        <p> Platform Nine never saw him again—but the train felt a little emptier without him.</p>

        <h1>2. The Girl Who Collected Sunsets</h1>
        <p>Mira lived in a quiet village by the sea and spent every evening painting sunsets. Each one was carefully
            numbered, stored, and protected. The villagers learned not to disturb her during dusk—it was the most
            important part of her day.</p>
        <p>One evening, dark storm clouds swallowed the sky before the sun could set. Furious and heartbroken, Mira
            painted the storm instead. The colors were harsh, messy, and emotional—nothing like her usual work. Yet when
            she finished, she felt something new: relief.</p>
        <p>From then on, she painted everything—storms, shadows, moonlight, even empty skies. Her art became deeper and
            more honest. The collection was no longer perfect, but it was alive.</p>
        <p>Years later, in a city gallery, someone asked her favorite painting. Mira pointed to the stormy canvas. That
            was the day she learned beauty doesn’t always arrive as planned—and sometimes, that makes it more real.</p>

        <h1>3. The Man Who Forgot Tomorrow</h1>
        <p>Elias remembered yesterday clearly but forgot tomorrow entirely. Doctors couldn’t explain it. He didn’t worry
            about it. Without a future to fear, his days were calm and complete. He fixed fences, helped neighbors, and
            cared for his cat.</p>
        <p>One day, a letter arrived labeled Open Tomorrow. Elias laughed and ignored it, but the letter kept
            returning—on tables, in pockets, under his pillow. Finally, curiosity won. Inside were the words: Tomorrow,
            you save someone.</p>
        <p>The next day, Elias felt uneasy. He paid closer attention to the world. Near the river, he saw a child slip
            on wet stones and pulled her to safety just in time.</p>

        <p>That night, Elias forgot tomorrow again—but not the feeling. From then on, he lived every day as if it
            mattered deeply, because even without remembering the future, his actions could still change it.</p>
