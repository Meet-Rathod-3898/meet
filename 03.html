    <span > The Minute That Stayed </span>

        <p>On the morning the clocks forgot how to tick, Mira woke to silence. Not the cozy hush of sleep, but a vast
            quiet,
            like the world holding its breath. Her alarm stared back, frozen at 7:12. Outside, pigeons hovered mid-flap,
            raindrops hung like beads, and a bus leaned forever into a turn.</p>
        <p>
            Mira stepped into the street, heart drumming louder than everything else combined. She tested the air with
            her hand. It felt warm, paused. She laughed once—small, nervous—and realized she could move. Only her.
        </p>
        <p>In a bakery, steam curled but never rose. She took a croissant and left a note anyway. In the park, she
            pushed a swing and watched it stop exactly where she wanted. Power, she decided, tasted like sugar and
            guilt.</p>
        <p>At noon—still 7:12—she found a boy on a bench, blinking hard, as if waking from a dream. He smiled, surprised
            to be smiling. “I thought I was alone,” he said.</p>
        <p>
            Together they wandered the unmoving city, fixing small things: setting a fallen bike upright, pulling a
            child away from a frozen fall, turning a crooked sign toward the sun. When the clocks resumed, sound rushed
            back like water.
        </p>
        <p>Mira never proved what happened. But sometimes, at 7:12, the world feels lighter, as if remembering kindness
