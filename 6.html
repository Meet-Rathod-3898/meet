        <summary>The Secret of Neon City</summary>
        <p>In the bright and busy Neon City, tall glass buildings touched the clouds and colorful lights glowed every
            night. Cars zoomed through the streets, and street performers made everyone smile.

            One evening, the city lights suddenly flickered and went out. The whole city became dark and quiet.

            Lena, a curious 12-year-old girl, noticed a strange glowing symbol shining on the tallest building. She
            climbed up to the rooftop and found a tiny floating light creature.

            “The city’s energy crystal is fading,” it said softly. “Only someone brave can restart it.”

            Lena followed the creature through secret rooftops and hidden doors until they reached the city’s power
            tower. Inside, a dark shadow was blocking the crystal’s light.

            With courage, Lena touched the crystal. It glowed brighter and brighter — and suddenly, Neon City lit up
            again!

            By morning, everything looked normal. But Lena smiled, knowing she was now the secret guardian of Neon City.

        <summary>The Clock Tower Secret</summary>
        <p>In the middle of Bright City stood an old clock tower that no one noticed anymore. One night, when the clock
            struck twelve, the hands started spinning wildly. A boy named Arjun saw a glowing door open inside the
            tower. Curious, he stepped in and discovered tiny time-keepers fixing broken moments in the city. When a
            shadow tried to stop them, Arjun helped reset the clock. By morning, the city felt happier — and only he
            knew why.</p>

        <summary>The Traffic Light Hero</summary>
        <p>In Metro City, the traffic lights suddenly stopped working. Cars honked, and people panicked. A clever girl
            named Zara discovered a mischievous electric sprite causing chaos underground. Instead of fighting it, she
            offered it a glowing battery candy. The sprite happily fixed the signals and promised to protect the city’s
            power. From that day on, the traffic lights blinked a little brighter.</p>

        <p>🌃 4️⃣ The Midnight Train

            Every night at exactly 1:00 AM, a silver train passed through Shadow City — but it wasn’t on any map.
            Curious twins Maya and Rohan jumped aboard and discovered it carried lost dreams back to their owners. When
            a dream almost faded away, the twins protected it until sunrise. The next day, the city felt full of hope
            again.</p>
